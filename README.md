The goal of this project is researching and hopefully come up with a new accessibility
option for people with dyslexia (reading disability). The project is based on
the research described [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/brb3.2114).

You can test it out live [here](http://dyslexia.westeurope.azurecontainer.io/).
The running solution is running as a Docker instance with the image found [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/einari/dyslexia/general).

View the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for details of every version as it is being developed.
