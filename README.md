This project aims at researching and possibly coming up with a new accessibility
option for people with dyslexia (reading disability). The project is based on
the research described [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/brb3.2114).

You can test it out live at [here](http://dyslexia.westeurope.azurecontainer.io/).
The running solution is running as a Docker instance with the image found [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/einari/dyslexia/general).
